&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="CppVersion.htm">Version</a> 3, 29 June 2007<br/>
<br/>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
 of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
software and other kinds of works.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The licenses <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> most software and other practical works are de<b><a href="CppSigned.htm">signed</a></b><br/>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast,<br/>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br/>
share and change all <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s of a program<a href="CppOperatorDecrement.htm">--</a>to <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> sure it remains free<br/>
software <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> all its users.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br/>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br/>
<a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> other work released <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> way by its authors.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can apply it to<br/>
your programs, too.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>
price.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are de<b><a href="CppSigned.htm">signed</a></b> to <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> sure that you<br/>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and <b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
them <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you wish), that you receive source code or can get it <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you<br/>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in <b><a href="CppNew.htm">new</a></b><br/>
free programs, and that you know you can <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> these things.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br/>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, you have<br/>
certain responsibilities <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you distribute copies of the software, or <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b><br/>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>
gratis or <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br/>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> sure that they, too, receive<br/>
or can get the source code.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they<br/>
know their rights.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br/>
(1) <a href="CppAssert.htm">assert</a> copyright on the software, and (2) offer you <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License<br/>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br/>
that there is no warranty <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> free software.&nbsp;&nbsp;For both users' and<br/>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s be marked as<br/>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br/>
authors of previous <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some devices are de<b><a href="CppSigned.htm">signed</a></b> to deny users access to install or run<br/>
modified <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br/>
can <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> so.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br/>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp;&nbsp;The systematic<br/>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> individuals to<br/>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we<br/>
have de<b><a href="CppSigned.htm">signed</a></b> <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> of the GPL to prohibit the practice <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> those<br/>
products.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br/>
stand ready to extend <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> provision to those domains in future <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s<br/>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br/>
<a href="CppState.htm">State</a>s should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br/>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b>, we wish to<br/>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br/>
<a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> it effectively proprietary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b>, the GPL assures that<br/>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise terms and conditions <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> copying, distribution and<br/>
modification follow.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;0. <a href="CppDefinition.htm">Definitions</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"This License" refers to <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br/>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Program" refers to <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> copyrightable work licensed under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each licensee is <a href="CppAddress.htm">address</a>ed as "you".&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licensees" and<br/>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br/>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br/>
exact copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting work is called a "modified <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>" of the<br/>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br/>
on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To "propagate" a work means to <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>thing with it that, without<br/>
permission, would <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> you directly or secondarily liable <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br/>
computer or modifying a <b><a href="CppPrivate.htm">private</a></b> copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Propagation includes copying,<br/>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br/>
<b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b>, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To "convey" a work means <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> kind of propagation that enables other<br/>
parties to <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> or receive copies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through<br/>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An interactive user <a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a> displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br/>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br/>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br/>
tells the user that there is no warranty <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> the work (except to the<br/>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br/>
work under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, and how to view a copy of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br/>
the <a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a> presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br/>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> criterion.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Source Code.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The "source code" <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a work means the preferred form of the work<br/>
<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> making modifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Object code" means <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> non-source<br/>
form of a work.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Standard <a href="CppInterface.htm">Interface</a>" means an <a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a> that either is an official<br/>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the <b><a href="CppCase.htm">case</a></b> of<br/>
<a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a>s specified <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a particular programming language, one that<br/>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The "System <a href="CppLibrary.htm">Libraries</a>" of an executable work include <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>thing, other<br/>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br/>
packaging a Major <a href="CppComponent.htm">Component</a>, but which is not part of that Major<br/>
<a href="CppComponent.htm">Component</a>, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br/>
Major <a href="CppComponent.htm">Component</a>, or to implement a Standard <a href="CppInterface.htm">Interface</a> <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> which an<br/>
implementation is available to the <b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b> in source code form.&nbsp;&nbsp;A<br/>
"Major <a href="CppComponent.htm">Component</a>", in <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> context, means a major essential <a href="CppComponent.htm">component</a><br/>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br/>
(<b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>) on which the executable work runs, or a <a href="CppCompiler.htm">compiler</a> used to<br/>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Corresponding Source" <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a work in object code form means all<br/>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> an executable<br/>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br/>
control those activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not include the work's<br/>
System <a href="CppLibrary.htm">Libraries</a>, or general-purpose <a href="Tools.htm">tools</a> or generally available free<br/>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br/>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source<br/>
includes <a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a> <a href="CppDefinition.htm">definition</a> files associated with source files <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
the work, and the source code <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> shared libraries and dynamically<br/>
<a href="CppLink.htm">link</a>ed subprograms that the work is specifically de<b><a href="CppSigned.htm">signed</a></b> to require,<br/>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br/>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corresponding Source need not include <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>thing that users<br/>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br/>
Source.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corresponding Source <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a work in source code form is that<br/>
same work.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All rights granted under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License are granted <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> the term of<br/>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br/>
conditions are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License <b><a href="CppExplicit.htm">explicit</a></b>ly affirms your unlimited<br/>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output from running a<br/>
covered work is covered by <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License only <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> the output, given its<br/>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License acknowledges your<br/>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a>, run and propagate covered works that you <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> not<br/>
convey, without conditions so <b><a href="CppLong.htm">long</a></b> as your license otherwise remains<br/>
in force.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey covered works to others <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> the sole purpose<br/>
of having them <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> modifications exclusively <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> you, or provide you<br/>
with facilities <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> running those works, provided that you comply with<br/>
the terms of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License in conveying all material <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> which you <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b><br/>
not control copyright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered works<br/>
<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> you must <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br/>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> copies of<br/>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conveying under <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> other circumstances is permitted solely under<br/>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br/>
<a href="CppMake.htm">make</a>s it unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br/>
measure under <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br/>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br/>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br/>
measures.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you convey a covered work, you waive <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> legal power to forbid<br/>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br/>
is effected by exercising rights under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License with respect to<br/>
the covered work, and you disclaim <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> intention to limit operation or<br/>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br/>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br/>
technological measures.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br/>
receive it, in <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br/>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br/>
keep intact all notices stating that <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License and <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a><br/>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br/>
keep intact all notices of the absence of <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> warranty; and give all<br/>
recipients a copy of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may <b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> price or no price <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> each copy that you convey,<br/>
and you may offer support or warranty protection <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Conveying Modified Source <a href="CppVersion.htm">Version</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br/>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br/>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and giving a relevant date.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License and <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> conditions added under section<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"keep intact all notices".<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License to <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>one who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License will therefore apply, along with <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> applicable section 7<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License gives no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission to license the work in <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> other way, but it does not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invalidate such permission <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you have separately received it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) If the work has interactive user <a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a>s, each must display<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Legal Notices; however, <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> the Program has interactive<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a>s that <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work need not <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> them <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> so.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br/>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br/>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br/>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br/>
"aggregate" <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br/>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br/>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered work<br/>
in an aggregate does not cause <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License to apply to the other<br/>
parts of the aggregate.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br/>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br/>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License,<br/>
in one of these ways:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> software interchange.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer, valid <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> at least three years and valid <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href="CppLong.htm">long</a></b> as you offer spare parts or customer support <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> that product<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model, to give <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>one who possesses the object code either (1) a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the Corresponding Source <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> all the software in the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;product that is covered by <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, on a durable physical<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medium customarily used <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> software interchange, <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a price no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than your reasonable cost of physically performing <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source from a network server at no <b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with subsection 6b.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place (gratis or <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a <b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge), and offer equivalent access to the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further <b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge.&nbsp;&nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the place to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> as <b><a href="CppLong.htm">long</a></b> as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Convey the object code <b><a href="CppUsing.htm">using</a></b> peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source of the work are being offered to the general <b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b> at no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge under subsection 6d.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br/>
from the Corresponding Source as a System <a href="CppLibrary.htm">Library</a>, need not be<br/>
included in conveying the object code work.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "User <a href="CppProduct.htm">Product</a>" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a><br/>
tangible personal property which is normally used <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> personal, family,<br/>
or household purposes, or (2) <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>thing de<b><a href="CppSigned.htm">signed</a></b> or sold <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> incorporation<br/>
into a dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br/>
doubtful <b><a href="CppCase.htm">case</a></b>s shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a particular<br/>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br/>
typical or common use of that <b><a href="CppClass.htm">class</a></b> of product, regardless of the status<br/>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br/>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp;&nbsp;A product<br/>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br/>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br/>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Installation Information" <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a User <a href="CppProduct.htm">Product</a> means <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> <a href="CppMemberFunction.htm">member function</a>s,<br/>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br/>
and execute modified <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s of a covered work in that User <a href="CppProduct.htm">Product</a> from<br/>
a modified <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp;&nbsp;The information must<br/>
suffice to ensure that the <b><a href="CppContinue.htm">continue</a></b>d <a href="CppFunction.htm">function</a>ing of the modified object<br/>
code is in no <b><a href="CppCase.htm">case</a></b> prevented or interfered with solely because<br/>
modification has been made.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you convey an object code work under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> section in, or with, or<br/>
specifically <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> use in, a User <a href="CppProduct.htm">Product</a>, and the conveying occurs as<br/>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br/>
User <a href="CppProduct.htm">Product</a> is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a<br/>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is <a href="CppChar.htm">character</a>ized), the<br/>
Corresponding Source conveyed under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> section must be accompanied<br/>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;But <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> requirement does not apply<br/>
<b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> neither you nor <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> third party retains the ability to install<br/>
modified object code on the User <a href="CppProduct.htm">Product</a> (<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> example, the work has<br/>
been installed in ROM).<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br/>
requirement to <b><a href="CppContinue.htm">continue</a></b> to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br/>
<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
the User <a href="CppProduct.htm">Product</a> in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to a<br/>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br/>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br/>
protocols <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> communication across the network.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br/>
in accord with <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> section must be in a format that is <b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b>ly<br/>
documented (and with an implementation available to the <b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b> in<br/>
source code form), and must require no special password or key <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <a href="CppAdd.htm">Add</a>itional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="CppAdd.htm">Add</a>itional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
License by making <a href="CppException.htm">exception</a>s from one or more of its conditions.<br/>
<a href="CppAdd.htm">Add</a>itional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br/>
be treated as though they were included in <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, to the extent<br/>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional permissions<br/>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br/>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br/>
<b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License without regard to the additional permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br/>
remove <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> additional permissions from that copy, or from <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> part of<br/>
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="CppAdd.htm">Add</a>itional permissions may be written to require their own<br/>
removal in certain <b><a href="CppCase.htm">case</a></b>s when you modify the work.)&nbsp;&nbsp;You may place<br/>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br/>
<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> other provision of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> material you<br/>
add to a covered work, you may (<b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> authorized by the copyright holders of<br/>
that material) supplement the terms of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License with terms:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms of sections 15 and 16 of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requiring that modified <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s of such material be marked in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable ways as different from the original <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Limiting the use <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> <b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b>ity purposes of names of licensors or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authors of the material; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> use of some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material by <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>one who conveys the material (or modified <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those licensors and authors.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br/>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program as you<br/>
received it, or <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br/>
governed by <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License along with a term that is a further<br/>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a license document contains<br/>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br/>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br/>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you add terms to a covered work in accord with <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> section, you<br/>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br/>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br/>
where to find the applicable terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="CppAdd.htm">Add</a>itional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br/>
form of a separately written license, or stated as <a href="CppException.htm">exception</a>s;<br/>
the above requirements apply either way.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Termination.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br/>
provided under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br/>
modify it is <b><a href="CppVoid.htm">void</a></b>, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br/>
<b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License (including <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> patent licenses granted under the third<br/>
paragraph of section 11).<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you cease all violation of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, then your<br/>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br/>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder <b><a href="CppExplicit.htm">explicit</a></b>ly and<br/>
<b><a href="CppFinal.htm">final</a></b>ly terminates your license, and (b) permanently, <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> the copyright<br/>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br/>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br/>
reinstated permanently <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> the copyright holder notifies you of the<br/>
violation by some reasonable means, <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> is the first <a href="CppTime.htm">time</a> you have<br/>
received notice of violation of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License (<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> work) from that<br/>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br/>
your receipt of the notice.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of your rights under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> section does not terminate the<br/>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br/>
<b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br/>
reinstated, you <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> not qualify to receive <b><a href="CppNew.htm">new</a></b> licenses <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> the same<br/>
material under section 10.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Acceptance Not Required <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> Having Copies.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not required to accept <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License in order to receive or<br/>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br/>
occurring solely as a consequence of <b><a href="CppUsing.htm">using</a></b> peer-to-peer transmission<br/>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,<br/>
nothing other than <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License grants you permission to propagate or<br/>
modify <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> covered work.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions infringe copyright <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b><br/>
not accept <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br/>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License to <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> so.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each <a href="CppTime.htm">time</a> you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br/>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br/>
propagate that work, subject to <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not responsible<br/>
<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> enforcing compliance by third parties with <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br/>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br/>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If propagation of a covered<br/>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br/>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br/>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br/>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br/>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b><br/>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not impose <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> further restrictions on the <a href="CppExercise.htm">exercise</a> of the<br/>
rights granted or affirmed under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may<br/>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other <b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> <a href="CppExercise.htm">exercise</a> of<br/>
rights granted under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, and you may not initiate litigation<br/>
(including a cross-claim or <a href="CppCounter.htm">counter</a>claim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br/>
<a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> patent claim is infringed by making, <b><a href="CppUsing.htm">using</a></b>, selling, offering <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b><br/>
sale, or importing the Program or <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> portion of it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Patents.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br/>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>".<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br/>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br/>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br/>
by <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, of making, <b><a href="CppUsing.htm">using</a></b>, or selling its contributor <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>,<br/>
but <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br/>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp;&nbsp;For<br/>
purposes of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> <a href="CppDefinition.htm">definition</a>, "control" includes the right to grant<br/>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br/>
<b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br/>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br/>
<a href="CppMake.htm">make</a>, use, sell, offer <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br/>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> express<br/>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br/>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br/>
sue <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> patent infringement).&nbsp;&nbsp;To "grant" such a patent license to a<br/>
party means to <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br/>
patent against the party.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br/>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>one<br/>
to copy, free of <b><a href="CppChar.htm">char</a></b>ge and under the terms of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, through a<br/>
<b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b>ly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br/>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br/>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br/>
patent license <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br/>
consistent with the requirements of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, to extend the patent<br/>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowingly relying" means you have<br/>
actual knowledge that, but <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> the patent license, your conveying the<br/>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br/>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br/>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br/>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br/>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br/>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br/>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br/>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br/>
work and works based on it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A patent license is "discriminatory" <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> it does not include within<br/>
the <a href="CppScope.htm">scope</a> of its coverage, prohibits the <a href="CppExercise.htm">exercise</a> of, or is<br/>
conditioned on the non-<a href="CppExercise.htm">exercise</a> of one or more of the rights that are<br/>
specifically granted under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not convey a covered<br/>
work <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br/>
in the business of distributing software, under which you <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> payment<br/>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br/>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> of the<br/>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br/>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br/>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br/>
<b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br/>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br/>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License shall be cons<b><a href="CppTrue.htm">true</a></b>d as excluding or limiting<br/>
<a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br/>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, they <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> not<br/>
excuse you from the conditions of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot convey a<br/>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
License and <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br/>
not convey it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you agree to terms that obligate you<br/>
to collect a royalty <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> further conveying from those to whom you convey<br/>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> other provision of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License, you have<br/>
permission to <a href="CppLink.htm">link</a> or combine <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> covered work with a work licensed<br/>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br/>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b><br/>
License will <b><a href="CppContinue.htm">continue</a></b> to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br/>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br/>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br/>
combination as such.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Revised <a href="CppVersion.htm">Version</a>s of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or <b><a href="CppNew.htm">new</a></b> <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s of<br/>
the GNU General Public License from <a href="CppTime.htm">time</a> to <a href="CppTime.htm">time</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such <b><a href="CppNew.htm">new</a></b> <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s will<br/>
be similar in spirit to the present <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>, but may differ in detail to<br/>
<a href="CppAddress.htm">address</a> <b><a href="CppNew.htm">new</a></b> problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> is given a distinguishing <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the<br/>
Program specifies that a certain numbered <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> of the GNU General<br/>
Public License "or <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> later <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>" applies to it, you have the<br/>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br/>
<a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> or of <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> later <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> published by the Free Software<br/>
Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> number of the<br/>
GNU General Public License, you may choose <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a> <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> ever published<br/>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br/>
<a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br/>
<b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b> statement of acceptance of a <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> permanently authorizes you<br/>
to choose that <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a> <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Later license <a href="CppVersion.htm">version</a>s may give you additional or different<br/>
permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a><br/>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br/>
later version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br/>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br/>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br/>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br/>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>
PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br/>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br/>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Limitation of Liability.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br/>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br/>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br/>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br/>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br/>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br/>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br/>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br/>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br/>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br/>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br/>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br/>
copy of the Program in <b><a href="CppReturn.htm">return</a></b> <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a fee.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you develop a <b><a href="CppNew.htm">new</a></b> program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
possible use to the <b><a href="CppPublic.htm">public</a></b>, the best way to achieve <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> is to <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> it<br/>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b> so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest<br/>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br/>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br/>
the "copyright" line and a <a href="CppPointer.htm">pointer</a> to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the program does terminal interaction, <a href="CppMake.htm">make</a> it output a <b><a href="CppShort.htm">short</a></b><br/>
notice like <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> when it starts in an interactive mode:<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;program&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;name of author&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> details type `show w'.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under certain conditions; type `show c' <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> details.<br/>
<br/>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br/>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, your program's commands<br/>
might be different; <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> a GUI <a href="CppInterface.htm">interface</a>, you would use an "<a href="CppAbout.htm">about</a> box".<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You should also get your employer (<b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> you work as a programmer) or school,<br/>
<b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> <a href="CppAny.htm">any</a>, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" <b><a href="CppFor.htm">for</a></b> the program, <b><a href="CppIf.htm">if</a></b> necessary.<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br/>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your program is a subroutine <a href="CppLibrary.htm">library</a>, you<br/>
may consider it more useful to permit <a href="CppLink.htm">link</a>ing proprietary <a href="CppApplication.htm">application</a>s with<br/>
the <a href="CppLibrary.htm">library</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> is what you want to <b><a href="CppDo.htm">do</a></b>, use the GNU Lesser General<br/>
Public License instead of <b><a href="CppThis.htm">this</a></b> License.&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, please read<br/>
