Richel Bilderbeek's work

* A collection of console, desktop (Qt and VCL) and web (Wt) applications
* A desktop application called ProjectRichelBilderbeekDesktop (in Projects) containing the bundled (Qt) desktop applications
* A web application called ProjectRichelBilderbeekWebsite (in Projects) containing the bundled (Wt) web applications
* A console application called ProjectRichelBilderbeekConsole (in Projects) containing the bundled console applications
* C++ Builder Windows-only code, to be ported to cross-platform Qt Creator code
* The core of Richel Bilderbeek's HTML website

ProjectRichelBilderbeek does not include:
* Binaries (zipped nor unzipped)
* Zipped source
* HTML pages for viewing the source

This to not be too big of a burden for github.

Libraries used that are also in this repository are:
* [Boost (version 1.53.0)](http://www.boost.org)
* [Qwt (version 6.0.01)](http://qwt.sourceforge.net)
* [Warp's function parser (versions 4.4.3 and 4.5.1)](http://warp.povusers.org/FunctionParser)
* [Matt McCutchen's BigInteger (version 2010.04.30)](https://mattmccutchen.net/bigint)

These libraries are added to allow easy crosscompilation to Windows using the often-supplied 'crosscompile.sh' scripts.
